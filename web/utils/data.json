  "aboutMe": "Hey there! I'm a Full-Stack Engineer with a passion for building scalable, user-friendly applications. My expertise spans JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Python, and Django, allowing me to develop seamless experiences across web and mobile platforms. I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and architecting efficient systemsâ€”whether it's crafting intuitive UIs, building robust APIs, or deploying applications to the cloud. Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into AI and machine learning, exploring how to integrate intelligent solutions into modern applications. Beyond coding, I love staying up to date with the latest tech, contributing to open-source projects, and engaging with the developer community. When Iâ€™m not building something, youâ€™ll probably find me experimenting with new AI models, fine-tuning a mobile app, or enjoying a strong cup of coffee. Letâ€™s build something amazing together! ðŸš€"
